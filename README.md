# 🎓 Student Course Tracker

A Python CLI application for managing courses, students, and grades.

## 💡 Why I Built This

This was my first project using object-oriented programming. I wanted to learn how to structure data using classes, track state, and build a simple command-line interface from scratch.

## 🛠 Features

- Create and manage multiple courses
- Add students to courses
- Assign grades and view student performance
- Export course reports to `.txt` files

## 🔧 Tech & Concepts

- Python OOP (classes, methods, instance attributes)
- CLI input handling and data validation
- File writing for text-based exports

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Open a terminal in the project folder  
3. Run the app:

```bash
python main.py
